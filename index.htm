<h3>The school has extended to the level that students in basic 3 to basic 5 are offering Further Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Basic Technology, Sratch, Python (but not yet fully started the python).In this school the students write test twice a term in the college session and they do not make use of test time tabletable to study. They read every book that they think that they might have but most times the book you might have read might not be what you might write so that is why the principle adviced that students should read their book for 2 hours per day.</h3>

<h3>Some people say that the work is too much for a child but its not. Its actually what i call "UPGRADING A CHILD'S BRAIN ON WHAT HE /SHE WOULD DO HE/SHE GETS TO COLLEGE " </h3>

<h3>As for the college students they are equally learning Sratch, Python. They had advanced to the level that they are learning STEM (Science Technology Engineering Mathematics) and they are equally doing makeup.</h3>
